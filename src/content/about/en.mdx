## The Story That Changed My Story

> The year was 2004. The CEO couldn't get past slide 8. 1,248 slides were waiting. 27 brands would die if he said no.

That was the scene that redefined my career. Faced with an exhausted executive and a R$500 million project about to be rejected, I did the only thing my gut screamed at me to do: I ditched PowerPoint and turned 1,248 slides into theater. The CEO cried. The project was approved. And I discovered my mission: **to prove that no presentation needs to be boring** [1].

My name is Fernando Palacios. I am the grandson of a filmmaker, the son of an engineer and a psychologist. I was supposed to be an engineer, but a question haunted me: **why do some stories change everything while others change nothing?** This obsession led me to explore uncharted territory, which earned me the nickname "the Christopher Columbus of Storytelling" [2].

## The Timeline of a Narrative Revolution

My journey has been a series of "firsts," breaking paradigms and building a new discipline in Latin America.

## My Philosophy: The Science Behind Emotion

> "Just because something is serious, doesn't mean it has to be boring."

I believe that every human is wired for stories. It's our operating system. Yet, 99% of corporate communication ignores this. I exist to fix this problem, one presentation at a time.

### My 3 Pillars:

1.  **Clarity is Power**: If I can't explain it in 30 seconds, I haven't understood it properly.
2.  **Emotion is Logic**: Data convinces, but emotion moves to action.
3.  **Practice Leads to Magic**: Storytelling is not a gift, it's training. It's a muscle that can be developed.

## The Numbers of My Journey

| Metric | Number | What It Means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Professionals Trained** | **30,000+** | A generation of leaders who know how to tell stories |
| **C-Level Executives** | **200+** | From the 500 largest companies in Brazil |
| **Countries with Activities** | **10** | The method works in any culture |
| **Project Approval Rate** | **+75%** | Using the STORYPITCH methodology [6] |
| **Instagram Followers** | **176,000+** | Real engagement through narratives |
| **World Awards** | **2** | World's Best Storyteller (2017, 2018) |

## The Mentor Behind the Biggest Brands

My greatest satisfaction is seeing the method work on a global scale, in the hands of brands I admire.

**Global Clients:**

- **Technology**: Google, IBM
- **Consumer Goods**: Nike, Coca-Cola, Absolut, Skol Beats
- **Automotive**: Yamaha
- **Healthcare**: Pfizer
- **Finance**: Itaú

At **Yamaha**, the method became culture and was exported to the headquarters in Japan. At **Pfizer**, I had the honor of coordinating the launch narrative for the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. At **Google**, I trained the team to present AI projects to the global CEO. Each of these challenges proved that a good narrative structure is the most powerful business tool that exists.

## Shall We Build Your Next Great Story?

If you have an idea, a project, or a brand and you need the world to pay attention, you don't need more data. You need a better story.

I'm here to help you build it.
